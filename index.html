<h1>My Favorate Hobby</h1>
<h2>Dancing</h2>

<h4>Dance is a performing art. ... The dance may be an informal play, a part of a ritual, or a part of a professional performance. There are many kinds of dances, and every human society has its own dances. As with other performing arts, some people dance to express their feelings and emotions, or to feel better.</h4>
